I‚Äôm also a game developer and fullstack web developer, with a preference for frontend due to my interest in design. I‚Äôm Brazilian, from the northeast, and I‚Äôve been part of the furry culture for about two years, with my fursona described further down on this page. Currently, I‚Äôm preparing for or have already started a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. During this time, I will be offline from social media.

        "nf_content": "\"The Nightmare Fable: Veils of Lives\" is an RPG and ARG third-person game currently in development (though on hiatus), with a planned release in 2027. It features charismatic characters and an engaging storyline that explores delicate social, ethical, moral, and psychological issues. The story revolves around two friends: a bat named Sunset and a dog named Rover. Sunset has strange dreams that reveal the path they must follow. After some time, Rover gets lost in a forest that hides a small time rift. You take on the role of Sunset (using your own name and a \"special\" random name revealed during the game), who follows Rover and ends up entering the same rift, encountering various worlds and universes controlled by a single god. Trapped in the Hall of the Veils of Lives, your mission is to cross the six available veils, each leading to a unique world, to gain advice and advance the story. However, a seventh veil remains mysteriously blocked, fueling theories and secrets that may be revealed by solving riddles both in the game and in the associated ARG. During your journey, you form friendships (or enmities) with characters inspired by controversial historical and religious figures. In the end, an epic battle takes place against the god of that universe, resembling a large anthropomorphic lamb with three horns. Unfortunately, due to personal issues and unavailability for two consecutive years, the development of the game has been affected.",
